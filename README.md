# cryptoclustering

This project applies K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to group cryptocurrencies based on short-term price changes. Using 24-hour and 7-day percentage changes, the model identifies meaningful patterns and visual clusters.

Unsupervised machine learning techniques were applied to both the original scaled data and PCA-reduced features. hvPlot was used to create interactive visualizations and compare clustering performance.

## Results
- Optimal number of clusters: k =3
- PCA preserved 1000% of the variance from the original data.
- Clustering results were visually and structurally similar before and after PCA.
- Composite plots were used to compare elbow curves and cluster visualizations.

This challenge was completed for educational purposes as part of a beginner data analytics bootcamp.  
All work followed project guidelines and used publicly available tools and documentation.
